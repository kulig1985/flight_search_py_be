    Search API

    For existing users using the api.skypicker.com endpoint:\\ You need to have an affiliate (partner) ID. This ID is used across Kiwi.com services to distinguish between partners. In this API, for all endpoints, you need to specify it in query parameter `partner`.  For new users of the Kiwi.com APIs:\\ Please register to our Tequila portal at [tequila.kiwi.com](https://tequila.kiwi.com/) to get your unique API key and use the new API there.  This API provides several options how to search for itineraries. At the moment there are different type of itineraries and different endpoints how to search for them. For oneway and roundtrip itineraries /flights endpoint need to be used. If you want to search for itineraries with multiple stops and you know exactly in which order you want them, then use our multicity searching which is available on /flights/multicity endpoint. Finally if you want to search for itineraries where you know the start and end of you journey and you know all the stops, but you don't mind in which order then you can use our Nomad searching which is available on /traveling_salesman endpoint.  Response from all endpoints will contain a list of itineraries, where each itinerary contain a link leading directly to Kiwi.com booking page where the user can book the specified flight. Each itinerary will also contain booking token which is needed in [Booking API](https://docs.kiwi.com/#header-booking-api).  Please note that all parameters marked as \"Deprecated\" are still accepted, although later they will be decommissioned. Some of them will be decommissioned completely and some of them can be replaced with other more powerful parameters. More information can be found in the description of the actual parameter.  # noqa: E501
